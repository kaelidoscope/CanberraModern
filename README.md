 Assignment 2
## Development Process
### Setup
    After attending the in class tutorials, I felt rather confident in being able to grapple with the assignment task. When finally sitting down to play around with the Nuxt frame work and divvy up some webiste pages and code, I ran into a few errors. At first I thought these were due to the inital setup I had used to create my project directory, which resulted in a cavalcade of russian nesting dolls of folders within folders within folders, etc. After troubleshooting those, I kept receiving an error message when attempting to install the yarn dependencies. When I finally read the error message, I discovered it was due to my PC's execution policies being set to restricted. This was circumvented with a simple CLI code.
    `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
    This enabled me to install the yarn dependencies, and launch the Nuxt builder on a local server.

    After all that, I double checked the repository was working with Github and began coding.
